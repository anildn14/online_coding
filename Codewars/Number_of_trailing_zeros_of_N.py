Write a program that will calculate the number of trailing zeros in a factorial of a given number.

N! = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * N

Be careful 1000! has 2568 digits...

Examples

zeros(6) = 1
# 6! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 = 720 --> 1 trailing zero

zeros(12) = 2
# 12! = 479001600 --> 2 trailing zeros
test.describe("Sample Tests")
test.it("Should pass sample tests")
test.assert_equals(zeros(0), 0, "Testing with n = 0")
test.assert_equals(zeros(6), 1, "Testing with n = 6")
test.assert_equals(zeros(30), 7, "Testing with n = 30")

def zeros(n):
    return 0
